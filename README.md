**Your smartphone, but dumb again.**

NokiaX is a one-click Bash + ADB tool that transforms any Android smartphone into a Nokia-style minimal phone by removing distracting and non-essential apps.

It removes social media, browsers, video apps, and other addictive software while keeping only basic and important apps like calls, messages, camera, music, radio, games, navigation, and messaging apps.
